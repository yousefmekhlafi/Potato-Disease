# potato-disease
Blight disease detection for potato crops. Also, (to be added later tomato crops as well). Check the README file for an explicit description where each segment of the code came from


The goal and challenge of this portfolio project is to convert and package a DL classification model into an industry-grade deployable application. The dataset EDA, model training and evaluation were provided by Codebasics. As for the project structure, and the MLops and ML Engineering aspects of it were provided by Krish Naik and entbappy.

Project Structure and steps (Personal effort)

Step 1: Create template for automated creation of directories and files

Step 2: Create requirements.txt and setup.py 

Step 3: Creating logging, exception handling and utils modules (mostly copy pasted)

Step 4: Conducting the entire experiment in a jupyter notebook (already coded along with Codebasics YT video (see link above))

Step 5: Project workflow for modular conversion of experiment notebooks into app components and pipelines 

1- Update config.yaml
2- params.yaml
3- Update entity
4- Update configuration manager in src config
5- Update components
6- Update pipelines
7- Update main.py
8- Update app.py
